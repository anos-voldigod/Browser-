# Browser-
## My Own Browser
This project is a simple web browser built using Python and PyQt5. The application provides basic browsing functionality, including loading web pages, navigating back and forward, and reloading pages. It also includes a URL bar that allows users to enter web addresses or search queries.

### Features
1. Web Page Viewing: The main window of the application loads web pages and displays them using QWebEngineView.
2. Navigation: You can navigate back, forward, and reload the current page using the provided buttons.
3. URL Bar: A URL input bar is available to navigate to specific web pages. You can type a URL directly or enter a search query to be redirected to Google Search.
4. Search Functionality: If the input in the URL bar does not resemble a URL (e.g., no "http" or "."), it automatically performs a Google search.
